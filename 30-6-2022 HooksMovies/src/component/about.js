            <p style={{fontSize:"40px", color:"white"}}>The Co-Laboratory films are a unique collaboration between two teams of choreographers and filmmakers who create short dance films in a week, shortly before the annual San Francisco Dance Film Festival. The intention is not to create the perfect film, but to bring professional artists into the atmosphere of a laboratory, one that challenges them to think collaboratively and explore possibilities for expression outside their fields. Funded in part by the Kenneth Rainin Foundation, the Fleishhacker Foundation, and the Zellerbach Family Foundation, the Co-Laboratory is an annual event to inspire and support local artists of different disciplines to collaboratively create dance films for local and global audiences.
